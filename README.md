# Scoreboard :game_die:

## Project Overview
The Scoreboard is a React.js application which allows for users to monitor users scores when playing any games, which I created at the start of my React.js journey. The application is based off of a Treehouse tutorial which can be accessed [here](). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
The inital work was completed by following along the with the Treehouse tutorial, with some small edits along the way.
